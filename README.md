#  Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Objective
Use pandas to read, process, clean, and analyze data from a CSV file.


## Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary libraries, specifically `pandas` and `openpyxl`, to handle data manipulation and Excel file exports.

### Task Steps 

1. **Load the Data**
   - Load the employee data from the provided CSV file named `employee_data.csv` using pandas library.

2. **Inspect the Data**
   - Print the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand its structure and content.
   - Display the count of missing values for each column in the dataset.
   - Identify and list any duplicate rows in the dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove any rows that contain missing data.
   - Drop any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Calculate and display the department with the highest average salary.
   - Determine and print the number of employees in each department.

5. **Data Export**
   - Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new Excel file named `cleaned_emplData.xlsx`.
   - Screenshot  the console then add it on this directory.
     
### Expected Output
Upon completing the tasks, you will have:
- The original data inspected for missing values and duplicates.
- solution.py file.

- The console will display the following information: 
    the first 5 rows of the dataset, the count of missing values along with their corresponding columns, any duplicated rows, the department name with the highest average salary, and the number of employees in each department.
- A cleaned DataFrame with missing data and duplicates removed.
- An Excel file (`cleaned_emplData.xlsx`) containing the cleaned employee data.
- Screenshot  the console then add it on this directory.
- **Output_example.png** - use this snippet to get an idea of an expected output.
